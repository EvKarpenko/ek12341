 <h3> Nyan Cat</h3>

<p> <strong> In third place </strong>, we have the nyan cat.It is iconic for it's pixelated style and upbeat music. It blew the internet away with its popularity
 in 2011 and is still around today. It was made when a youtuber combined a japanese song tht you hear playing in the background with the animation of the cat. The legend behind this wonder of pixels is Chris Torrez. At the time, he was a small creator posting his art and doing charity donation streams but one of the ideas from thsoe streams is what we can now call, the Nyan Cat. 
 The song lyrics mainly consists of the words 'nya' or 'nyan' which in onomatopoeia for a cat's meow in japanese. It's getting a 7.8/10 on the cool-cat-meter just
 because I personally find it oddly funny and full of a joyfull personality. If you want to find out more, watch the 10 minute video beliw for more details and a full timeline of the nyan cat's history.</p>

<h3>Dinner Cat</h3>
<p>
<strong> In second place</strong>, we have the 'Dinner Cat'
. It is iconic for its almost disgusted and over-exaggerated face. It started in summer 2018 and took the meme comunity by storm, it's still used today! It is a picture of a white cat at a dinner table and commonly paired with a piture of a woman pointing and shouting (a picture from a "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"). There is not much information about the cat on the web other than that his name is Smudge. I give it a 9/10 on the cool-cat-meter because I relate to his confused mood and it can make a perfect meme if paired with the right caption. 
 
 <h4> Unfortunately, a working image for this masterpiece could not be found. I apologise for the technical difficulty.</h4>

<h3>Dabloon Cat</h3>
<p>
<strong>Last, and definitely best </strong>, we have the Dabloon Cat. It started around winter 2022 on TikTok from a picture of a black cat holding up its "toe beans" (which is a slang word for the pads on the bottom of a cats paw) with the caption: 4 Dabloons. It then became a trend as a virtual currency with which anyone could buy virtual items. You could recieve or give away the dabloons, items, potions, etc, all within the TikTok app through videos on your FYP (For You Page). There would even be things like inflation and different clubs that you could join! I believe it deserves a 10/10 on the meter because of how well it brought the whole TikTok community together and how everyone had fun collecting, selling and more just through a picture of a cat with its paw up. It was a great experiece while it lasted before it came to a slow end during the first few days of 2023. Here is a quick video to sum it up-
