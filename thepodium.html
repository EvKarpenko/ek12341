 <h3> Nyan Cat</h3>

<p> <strong> In third place </strong>, we have the nyan cat.It is iconic for it's pixelated style and upbeat music. It blew the internet away with its popularity
 in 2011 and is still around today. It was made when a youtuber combined a japanese song tht you hear playing in the background with the animation of the cat. The legend behind this wonder of pixels is Chris Torrez. At the time, he was a small creator posting his art and doing charity donation streams but one of the ideas from thsoe streams is what we can now call, the Nyan Cat. 
 The song lyrics mainly consists of the words 'nya' or 'nyan' which in onomatopoeia for a cat's meow in japanese. It's getting a 7.8/10 on the cool-cat-meter just
 because I personally find it oddly funny and full of a joyfull personality. If you want to find out more, watch the 10 minute video beliw for more details and a full timeline of the nyan cat's history.</p>

<strong> In second place</strong>, we have the 'Dinner Cat'
. It is iconic for its almost disgusted and over-exaggerated face. It started in summer 2018 and took the meme comunity by storm, it's still used today!
