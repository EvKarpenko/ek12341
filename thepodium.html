 <h3> Nyan Cat</h3>

<p> <strong> In third place </strong>, we have the nyan cat.It is iconic for it's pixelated style and upbeat music. It blew the internet away with its popularity
 in 2011 and is still around today. It was made when a youtuber combined a japanese song tht you hear playing in the background with the animation of the cat.
 The song lyrics mainly consists of the words 'nya' or 'nyan' which in onomatopoeia for a cat's meow in japanese. It's getting a 7.8/10 on the cool-cat-meter just
 because I personally find it oddly funny.</p>
