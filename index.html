  <h1>The Coolest cat memes</h1>
  <p> I will be making this page about the coolest memes of  cats (in my opinion). I will be measuring the cool level by using the cool-cat-meter.</p>
  
  <h2>Honourable mentions</h2>
  <strong>In last place</strong>, we have any cute picture of a cat face (example picture below). It's just cute and deserves a mention on this list.Its simple to recreate with any tye of cat,even if its better with a floofy one, and is simple to look at. A solid 6/10 because its a bit boring its a bit boring.<br>

    <strong>Next </strong> is the Pop Cat it is a funny meme of a cat with its mouth open. There are many versions of this meme with it even ending up on cursors. It is a nice meme and I would give it a 6.5/10 becuase of its simplicity.
