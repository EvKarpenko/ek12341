    <h1>The Coolest cat memes</h1>
    <p> I will be making this page about the coolest memes of cats (in my opinion). I will be measuring the cool level by using the cool-cat-meter.</p>

    <h2>Honourable mentions</h2>
    <p>
      <strong> In last place</strong>, we have any cute picture of a cat face (example picture below). It's just adorable and deserves a mention on this list.Its simple to recreate with any tye of cat,even if its better with a floofy one, and is simple to look at. A solid 6/10 because its a bit boring.<br></p>

    <p><strong>Next </strong> is the Pop Cat it is a funny meme of a cat with its mouth open. There are many versions of this meme with it even ending up on cursors.It is a nice meme and it's pure weirdness deserves 6.5/10 becuase of its simplicity.</p>

<p><strong>Last honourable mention of this list</strong>, Beluga cat. It is a very popular meme that came from a picture of a "polite cat" becuase of it's nice smile (as shown in the image below). It is an internet personality that is portrayed by a cat on discrod chatting with other characters. It gets a 6.5/10 because it's very overused</p>
