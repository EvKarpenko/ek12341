    <h1> The Coolest Cat breeds </h1>
    <p> I will be making this page about the coolest breeds of (domesticated) cats (in my opinion). I will be measuring the cool level by using the cool-cat-meter.</p>
    
    <ol> 
      <li>And last, and definitely best:The bombay cat, arguably the best type of cat our there just becuase it is the breed my cat is. But actually, I believe it is the <br>
        <stong> best </stong> breed because it is full of character and hilarious moments. It is a super energetic breed and is always down for chasing a mouse around. <br>
        Overall, it's a 10\10 on the cool-cat-meter.
    </ol>
